# LeleNet
This repo was set up to save and share code for semantic segmentation and vegetation model building in the LELE project.
Requirements are—amongst others—installation of:
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/)
* [GDAL](https://gdal.org/)

since main workflows are based on this software. Additional requirements are listed in `requirements.txt` files within the subdirectory containing Python scripts and a summary is located in the main project directory.

## Extensive information can be found in the [LeleNet Wiki](https://github.com/ManuelPopp/LeleNet/wiki).
