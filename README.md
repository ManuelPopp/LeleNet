# LeleNet
This repo was set up to share code for semantic segmentation in the LELE project as described in "Testing the suitability of consumer-grade UAV imagery for semantic segmentation of savanna vegetation"<sup>1</sup>.
Requirements are—amongst others—installation of:
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (CNN training)
* [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/) (reference data creation)
* [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) (tile generation for training and deployment of CNN)

since main workflows are based on this software. Additional requirements are listed in `requirements.txt` files within the subdirectory containing Python scripts and a summary is located in the main project directory.

## Extensive information can be found in the [LeleNet Wiki](https://github.com/ManuelPopp/LeleNet/wiki).
