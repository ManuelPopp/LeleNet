# Contributing to Transcriptase
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ManuelPopp/LeleNet/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is a template](https://gist.github.com/carlo/3402842) for a bug report I you can use in case you are not sure about how a bug report should be structured. Give a MWE, if you can/if suitable. Screenshots and other images can be helpful, especially if the issue is related to image data. However, please refrain from attaching code or other text as images.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- A description of the expected outcome
- A detailled description of the actual outcome (including complete error messages)
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or descriptions of what you already tried and how it went out)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
